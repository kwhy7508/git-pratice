# git-practice

This repository is for practicing Git basics: staging, committing (≥5 commits), and pushing to GitHub.

## Files
 - `README.md` — this file
 - `.gitignore` — ignores common secret/config files
 - `app.py` — tiny Python script
 - `data/sample.txt` — example data
 - `notes.md` — notes for your practice

## How to use (quick)
 1. Create a **public** repo on GitHub named **`git-practice`**.
 2. In your terminal, run the commands in `push_to_github.sh` (or copy-paste step by step).
 3. Submit your repo URL as the title, e.g., `https://github.com/<yourid>/git-practice`.

 ⚠️ **Do not** commit secrets (passwords, tokens, *.pem, etc.).
